                  <p class="card-text">Currently, no system exists for RIT Students to easily and visually track their overall degree progress in both graduate and undergraduate programs. Instead, they must use the antiquated Student Information System (known internally as SIS) to find the courses they’ve completed as well as how many credits they’ve earned toward each facet of their degree (core classes, electives, etc.). The process as a whole is fragmented, confusing, and time-consuming.</p>

                <h2 class="card-title">The <span class="solution">Solution</span>:</h2>
                <p class="card-text">An interactive dashboard where students and academic advisors can easily track and monitor progress toward degree completion at a glance. Past courses (with credits and final grades), present enrollment, and future requirements will be pulled from the student's information and graphically displayed. The dashboard will display key milestones for the student as well as specific alerts to let them know of time-sensitive information. Students can be shown options to fulfill requirements in future semesters (such as a list of possible elective courses).</p>

              <div class="card-body">
                <h2 class="card-title">Audience and Stakeholders</h2>
                <p class="card-text">Anyone involved with a student's individual progress toward a degree is considered a stakeholder in this development. Primarily, the two groups with the highest prominence are the students themselves and the academic advisors that service student requests pertaining to their degree requirements.</p>
                <h3>The Students</h3>
                <p class="card-text">With a comprehensive, intuitive display of outstanding degree requirements as well as those already completed, students can more easily plan for their upcoming classes as well as feel a better sense of gratification seeing a more tangible representation of their end goal. It's also important that as much feedback is collected from the student body as possible; their comments and concerns can be translated into functional requirements for future versions of the service to deliver the best experience possible.</p>
                <h3>Academic Advisors</h3>
                <p class="card-text">Academic advisors would also have much to gain from this service being implemented. Many individual colleges within the university currently use a pen-and-paper worksheet system for tracking students' degree requirments, and students often need to meet with them to discuss this and plan for future semesters. The RIT Degree Tracker has the potential to cut down on much of this communication, freeing up academic advisors for more complex assignments. In order to address as many concerns as possible, they should be consulted early and often throughout the development process to ensure that the service is an adequate replacement for their meetings, and that it contains all necessary and pertinent information.</p>
                <h3>Working with Stakeholders</h3>
                <p id="tablecap" class="card-text">Throughout the design and development process, it's important that the stakeholders remain constantly involved to ensure the product meets or exceeds their expectations. Below is a table of different aspects of stakeholder involvement, as well as how our team will handle them.</p>

                  <ul class="team-rules">
                    <li><strong>Punctuality:</strong> All team members should attend working sessions on time and meet group deadlines. Any planned absences should be communicated in advance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Commitment:</strong> Each member of the team should commit to delivering quality work, or work which is completed to the best of their ability with the skills they have.</li>
                    <li><strong>Respect:</strong> Team members should behave professionally and be considerate of other team members.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collegiality:</strong> The distribution of tasks within the team should be well-balanced, and each person should contribute equally to the best of their ability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Open lines of communciation should always be maintained. Team group chats should be used to the fullest extent possible for most, if not all communication purposes (e.g. progress reports, issues, planned absences, etc.)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Grounds for Expulsion:</h3>
                  <p>If any team member repeatedly breaks one or more of the above rules, they may be liable for expulsion from the team. Such a decision would be made after the group has consulted internally as well as with the class professor about the offending student's behavior.</p>
