            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototypes are intended to show a rough idea of what a realized solution to our original problem statement might look like. Emphasis was put more on structure, sectioning, and central elements shared across all parts of the service rather than minute details, colors, or imagery.</p>
            <h3>Brainstorming Process</h3>
            <p>The team first came up with a list of concrete elements of the design that would need to be showcased, primarily from our original problem and solution statements. The core elements discussed were <strong>A Dashboard Page, Specific Alerts, Past Course Viewing, Present Enrollment, and Future Requirements</strong>.</p>
            <p>From there, the team split up and individually sketched some basic ideas of what the UI might look like. These can be seen in the &ldquo;Brainstorming/Sketches&rdquo; portion of the Figma board below. At our first convergence, the individual sketches were discussed and specific elements of each person&rsquo;s designs were highlighted and selected for further development. From there, digital wireframing began.</p>
            <p>After much of the digital renderings had been completed, a second meeting was held to review these designs and make any adjustments to ensure consistency and clarity. Certain frames within the design were also duplicated and edited to show changes in application states; since the overall design resides mainly on a single page, many of these are needed (and more will be needed in the future) to convey how information is dynamically displayed in the service. The lo-fi prototypes below serve as a starting point for this process, as they can rapidly change or evolve as the minutia are ironed out.</p>

            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>Below are some general notes pertaining to the designs included in the Figma board:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The entire service is being designed as a single-page application (SPA).</li>
              <li>Gray squares and circles within the designs represent FPO (For Placement Only) graphics which will be replaced with images, icons, or other visual elements later in the design process.</li>
              <li>Designs are not final and may be iterated upon prior to the completion of the Hi-Fi mockups and prototypes.</li>
