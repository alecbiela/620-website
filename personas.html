                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>Jeff is a second year Electrical Engineering student at RIT. This is also his second year in college and he is unsure of the courses he needs to take each semester. He plans to meet with his advisor during course registration to get additional in person help with planning and registering for courses.</p>
                <h4>Goals in SIS</h4>
                <p>Jeff uses SIS to track his degree progress. He uses SIS during advisement time to see which courses he needs to take by looking at the “Academic Requirements” section. He also meets with an advisor to double check that he hasn&rsquo;t missed anything.</p>
                <h4>Current Challenges in SIS</h4>
                <p>Jeff finds that there are too many menus and different screens which can be confusing. In addition to that, progress is sometimes not saved properly and can be lost. Jeff would like to have a centralized dashboard to make the experience more clear.</p>

                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>Amit is a national of New Delhi, India. He is a full-time international student in his 2nd year of the program. Amit hopes to meet all graduation requirements by the end of the year. He spends at least six hours per semester planning for classes outside SIS. This includes speaking with faculty and meeting with the academic advisor to receive advice on graduation requirements and program electives. After graduation, he wants to pursue a career in the tech industry in the US. That keeps him motivated to keep careful track of his progress on the degree.</p>
                <h4>Goals in SIS</h4>
                <p>Amit uses SIS to search and enroll in classes. He is mostly interested in two main basic current functionalities in the system SIS, searching for classes and enrolling in them.</p>
                <h4>Current Challenges in SIS</h4>
                <p>Amit thinks the SIS works well for academic purposes. However, he wishes there was an easy way of seeing his progress against degree requirements. Has tried to use the “Enroll by My Requirements” option, but the system prompts an error message every time.</p>

                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>Maria is a third year student enrolled in mechanical engineering. She currently resides off-campus in Rochester and recently transferred from Monroe Community College (MCC) after taking her first two years of courses through them. After a lengthy onboarding process with her advisor to sort out transfer credits and the first semester of courses, she would like to accomplish as much as possible on her own without involving the advisor.</p>
                <h4>Goals in SIS</h4>
                <p>To successfully complete her course schedule for next semester and beyond, Maria will need to identify her classes transferred from MCC for credit as well as where they fit on a roadmap for an undergraduate mechanical engineer. She will also need to calculate her cumulative GPA when applying for co-ops in the near future and plan the remainder of the courses she needs to take, semester-by-semester.</p>
                <h4>Current Challenges in SIS</h4>
                <p>Maria finds it difficult to see how, if at all, transfer credits impact her cumulative GPA, as there&rsquo;s no definitive breakdown of how it&rsquo;s calculated. She would like to better understand which requirements the transferred courses have satisfied. In addition, she&rsquo;s having trouble seeing how the courses are sequenced, or which courses have prerequisites, making it difficult to create a multi-semester roadmap of the courses remaining in the degree.</p>

                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>Adam is a full time RIT student from Madison, WI in his final year of a Computer Science bachelor&rsquo;s degree. Currently, Adam spends 2 - 3 hours  a semester in SIS. He only spends as much time as needed to find the classes he needs for the following semester. Since Adam is in his 5th year at RIT, he rarely meets with his advisor and uses SIS to view his academic requirements.</p>
                <h4>Goals in SIS</h4>
                <p>Adam&rsquo;s goal in SIS is to be able to use it as efficiently as possible. While being in his last year, he feels tracking a student&rsquo;s progress should be easy.</p>
                <h4>Current Challenges in SIS</h4>
                <p>Adam feels there are too many menu options and screens in SIS. Sometimes the user&rsquo;s progress is not always saved.</p>
